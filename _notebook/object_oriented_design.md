# object-oriented design (OOD)

**The three basic principles of OOD**

- **Encapsulation**: The ability to combine data and operations on that data in a single unit.
- **Inheritance**:   The ability to create new objects (classes) from existing objects (classes).
- **Polymorphism**:  The ability to use the same expression to denote different operations.
