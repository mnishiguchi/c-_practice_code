# Recursion

- The process of solving a problem by reducing it to smaller versions of itself is called recursion.
- Recursion is a very powerful way to solve certain problems for which the solution would otherwise be very complicated.

## Recursive definition:
A definition in which something is defined in terms of a smaller version of itself.

1. Every recursive definition **must have one (or more) base cases**.
2. The general case **must eventually be reduced to a base case**.
3. **The base case stops the recursion**.
