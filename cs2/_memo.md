## Passing by value v passing by reference
- passing by reference
    - Passing &argument into a function

```
// A Hero pointer is passed by value.
// NOTE: Since there is no &, this is not a reference.

/**
 * @param  {[type]} Hero* h             [description]
 * @return {[type]}       [description]
 */
void saveHero( Hero* h ) {

}
