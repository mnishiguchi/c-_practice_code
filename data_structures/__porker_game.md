# Porker game

## Description
- Poker hands of 5 cards can be ranked by certain combinations. For sake of this exercise, your code must look at a poker “hand” of five cards and decide how high the hand is.
- Hands can be as high as a straight flush.  For sake of this exercise, you only need to look for the following hands:

    - **Straight flush:**
        - the highest hand.
        - all five cards are arranged in contiguous order of rank and are of the same suit.
        - The highest straight flush goes from the rank of 10 to ace.  The lowest is ace to 5.

    - **Four of a kind:**
        - all four cards of a particular suit.

    - **Flush:**
        - all the cards of a hand are of the same suit.

    - **Three of a kind:**
        - three cards share the same rank.

    - **One pair:**
        - two cards share the same rank.

    - **High card:**
        - none of the above hands exist.  The highest card is the rank of Ace.

 
## A function that will somehow accept the five cards of a hand
- accepts the five cards of a hand and will examine the cards
- returns some way to indicate the highest hand from above


## Designing
- Write about how you would approach this problem.
- What classes will you use?
- How will the function indicate the hand?
- What data structures would be useful here? 
- What problems do you see in your approach?
- Feel free to include code, but this is more about designing a solution using your knowledge of data structures.
